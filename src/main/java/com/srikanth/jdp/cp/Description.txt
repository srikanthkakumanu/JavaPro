This module explores creational patterns, which represent patterns that are often used in place of direct instantiation with constructors.
Creational patterns make the creation process more adaptable and dynamic. In particular, they can provide a great deal of flexibility about
which objects are created, how those objects are created, and how they are initialized.
In this module, you will learn:
How creational patterns help programmers
Five well-known creational patterns
The elements of the Factory Method pattern
How to incorporate the Factory Method pattern into your course project
