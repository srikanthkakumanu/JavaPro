Thereâ€™s an isolated, forested place in Russia called the M-Triangle where people allegedly come out smarter than when they went in.
So smart, that in one case, a barely-employed, military washout became a cosmonaut after spending only two weeks there.
Mack Maloney, author of "Beyond Area 51," said researchers at the mysterious outpost have recorded the sounds of traffic speeding by them, 
even though the closest road is almost 40 miles away.
